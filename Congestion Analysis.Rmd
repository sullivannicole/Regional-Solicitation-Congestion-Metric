# Import packages

If you've never imported before, you'll need to run `install.packages("name of package here")` once.  After that, the packages will live in your local library.  All you need to do to import them is run the code chunk below.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
extrafont::loadfonts()
```

# Import StreetLight (SL) data

These two csv files were created from two different SL projects.  We used two projects because the maximum zones (in this case, a zone = a road segment) SL permits in a single congestion analysis project is 5,000.
